Topics in crypto: 
Different numbers have special properties. Primes, natural, irrational. Different sets of numbers.  
Big fun words to say! 
Mary queen of scotts → ceaser cyper → decrypted by fingerprinting 
Enigma machine → psuedorandomness 
Psuedorandomness 
Random is a new word!! 
How computers have changed encyrption

If you make a backdoor to one person, you make a vulnerability to everyone (key under the doormat) 
Who do you have to defend against 
Attack surface 
Show internet tcp protocal. Network packet. 
Public key cryptography with paint 
Key exchange and shared secret 

Tangible ex: Switches with light switches. Wire three together. Wire 12 together. 
Cs ex: Do key activity to talk about computers and brute forcing 

Openssl → it’s the program that you use to make https. Show them how to use it.  
GPG
Interesting question: length of password vs length of alphabet (password managers) 

Make a pot to look like a lock. So have dials instead of 
Make an engima machine > watch the video on
Implementation vs motivation

The more complicated the cyphers get, the harder it gets to go backwards. Modern cryptography is one way.
