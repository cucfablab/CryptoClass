# Escape through time
 
### Story line:
You are in the movie theater watching the movie 300 with your friends. All the sudden you are transported from your seat back to 404 BC Greece. Your mission is to hop forward through time until you return to your present. You must solve puzzles from each era in order to know which next era to travel to. These messages are written from your future self, 

Our future selves know what we need to have cryto-knowledge necessary to survive in the future - we can’t use modern technology otherwise we introduce anachronisms into the timeline POTENTIALLY CHANGING THE COURSE OF HISTORY. To help yourself get back to your own place in time, you must solve period-appropriate puzzles. Each puzzle will tell you where to go next into the future. 
 
How this works
-   each "Era" gets its own box or envelope. It'll say its location and time on the front. Once you crack one puzzle, you get to open the next.
 
## Sparta

### Narrative 
The year is 405 BC. Five messengers were dispatched from Persia, a questionable ally, to give you and Lysander of Sparta a secret message. Only one survives, although gravely wounded. Upon arriving he collapses, dead. On him is a belt with symbols running down it. You are equipped with a hexagonal scytale to help Lysander decipher the message. 

### Cards

### Narrative Card
The year is 405 BC. Five messengers were dispatched from Persia, a questionable ally, to give you and Lysander of Sparta a secret message. Only one survives, although gravely wounded. Upon arriving he collapses, dead. On him is a belt with symbols running down it. You are equipped with a hexagonal scytale to help Lysander decipher the message. 

### Scytale Card
A scytale is one of the oldest encryption tools, dating back to the fifth century BC. It helps decrypt transposition ciphers, in which the letters of a message are simply rearranged. A transposed message was often concealed on a belt, a form of stenography.

### Stenography (crypto) 
Secret communication achieved by hiding the existence of a message is known as stenography. Various forms of stenography have been used throughout the world for thousands of years. The ancient Chinese wrote messages on fine silk. The silk was scrunched into a tiny ball, covered with wax, and swallowed by a messenger. The ancient Greeks concealed messages by shaving the head of a messenger, tattooing the scalp, and waiting for the hair to regrow. The Italians even hid messages on hard-boiled eggs. The Italian scientist Giovanni Porta made an ink from alum and vinegar which, when applied on the shell of an egg, penetrated the shell but left a mark on harded egg albumen. The ink could be seen only when the shell was removed.

### Caesar Cipher Card 
A Caesar cipher is one of the earliest substitution ciphers known. A substitution cipher is a form of cryptographic substitution in which each letter of a message is replaced by another letter or symbol. A Caesar cipher is based on a cipher alphabet that is shifted a certain number of places (for example three) relative to a plain alphabet. 
```
Plain alphabet:        a b c d e f g h i …. 
Cipher alphabet:     D E F G H I J K …..  
```
If I were to encrypt the message: 
`Attack Gaul at dawn`

with a cipher alphabet shifted by three letters, the message would look like: 
`Dwwdfn Jdxo dw gdzq`

A cipher disk is a tool made to help encode substitution ciphers. Rotate the disk such that the outer wheel is a plain alphabet and the inner wheel is a cipher alphabet.

England = `jslqfsi` (shifted by five) 

(which is really a shift of five: Caesar approved his conclusion, although he was thereby disappointed in his expectation of obtaining three legions, and reduced to two; none the less, he still regarded speed as the only means to the general safety, and proceeded by forced marches into the borders of the Nervii. There he learnt from prisoners what was taking place at Cicero's station, and how dangerous was his case. Then he persuaded one of the Gallic troopers with great rewards to deliver a letter to Cicero. The letter he sent written in Greek characters, lest by intercepting it the enemy might get to know of our designs. The messenger was instructed, if he could not approach, to hurl a spear, with the letter fastened to the thong, inside the entrenchment of the camp. In the despatch he wrote that he had started with the legions and would speedily be with him, and he exhorted Cicero to maintain his old courage. Fearing danger, the Gaul discharged the spear, as he had been instructed. By chance it stuck fast in the tower, and for two days was not noticed by our troops; on the third day it was sighted by a soldier, taken down, and delivered to Cicero. He read it through, and then recited it at a parade of the troops, bringing the greatest rejoicing to all. Soon the smoke of the fires was to be seen in the distance, and this banished all doubt about the arrival of the legions.)

### How to solve the puzzle
Put the capitalizations in the narrative message together to look inside pilum. Use green 5 in 51 BC to decode the encoded message with a shift of 5. The message will read “England”. 
 
## England

### Narrative  
Mary Queen of Scots is on trial for plotting to murder Queen Elizabeth of England. She is currently imprisoned in Chartley Hall in Staffordshire, and messages from her Catholic loyalists are getting sent to her through Filbert Gifford, a double agent for both Catholic loyalists and the Protestant English crown. You are hired by Sir Francis Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth’s spymaster, to decode the messages relayed by Gifford. You need to learn more about code cracking, so you head to the royal library to find Al-Kindi’s book on cryptography.

A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages, Al-Kindi
Arab scholars were the first to invent cryptanalysis, the science of unscrambling a message without knowledge of the key. The science of code breaking has its origins in religious scholarship in the Arab world. Major theological schools were established in Basra, Kufa, and Baghdad in the ninth century AD, where theologians scrutinized the revelations of Muhammad as contained in the Koran. The theologians were interested in establishing the chronology of the revelations, which they did by counting the frequencies of words contained in each revelation. They also analyzed individual letters, and this apparently innocuous observation led to the first great breakthrough in cryptanalysis. 
  
The weakness of the Caesar cipher was published 800 years after the advent of the Caesar cipher by the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi. 
 
He broke the Caesar cipher by using a clue based on an important property of the language the message was written in. If you scan text from any book and count the frequency of each letter, you’ll find a fairly consistent pattern. For example, these are the letter frequencies of English:“ (Khan Academy)

```
Letter 	Percentage 	Letter 	Percentage 
A	8.2		N	6.7
B	1.5		O	7.5
C	2.8		P	1.9
D	4.3		Q	0.1
E	12.7		R	6.0
F	2.2		S	6.3
G	2.0		T	9.1
H	6.1		U	2.8
I	7.0		V	1.0
J	0.2	W	2.4
K	0.8	X	0.2
L	4.0	Y	2.0
M	2.4	Z	0.1
```

This can be thought of as a fingerprint of English. Given a section of English language, E, T, A and O are the most common, while Z, Q and X are rare. We leave this fingerprint when we communicate without realizing it. This clue is one of the most valuable tools for a codebreaker. To break this cipher, they count up the frequencies of each letter in the encrypted text and check how far the fingerprint had shifted. For example, if H is the most popular letter in the encrypted message instead of E, then the shift was likely 3. Simply reverse the shift and reveal the original message. This is called frequency analysis and that was a blow to the security of the Caesar cipher. 
 
A ciphertext with a shift of 3. Notice how ‘H’ is the most popular letter in the text. 
 
The ciphertext (in red) transposed onto English plaintext (in blue). Notice how the peaks in both histograms align when the ciphertext graph is shifted to the left by three letters.
